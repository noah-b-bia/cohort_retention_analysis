# Cohort & Retention Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project explores user retention using acquisition and behavioral cohorts.  
The goal was to measure retention rates, identify drop-off points, and recommend strategies for improving user engagement.

## 📊 Methods
- Built **acquisition cohorts** (based on first order date).  
- Created **behavioral cohorts** (based on recurring activity).  
- Calculated **retention rates** over time with pivot tables.  
- Designed a **conversion funnel** to track drop-offs.  
- Documented assumptions, data cleaning steps, and change log.  

## 💡 Key Findings
- Retention dropped significantly after the first month, with only a small core of active users long-term.  
- The largest drop-off occurred during the onboarding → first order stage.  
- Improving the onboarding flow could boost early retention.  

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Google Sheets**: Pivot tables, formulas (`DATEDIF`, `SUMIF`, `VLOOKUP`).  
- **Data Visualization**: Retention curves, funnel charts.  
- **Business Analysis**: Cohort frameworks for user engagement.
